# Java Practice w/ CodingBat!
## CodingBat Branch
A branch specifically made to hold all of the code I've written in Java to solve the problems over on CodingBat.

Code is mostly written by me, but since this is a practice site, there's a high possibility of someone else with similar code existing on GitHub.

Take a browse through to see some examples of the problem sets on CodingBat.
